# AkaLientess v2

Hello, :)

Welcome to AkaLientesS Project which is my Portfolio Website

This is a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) project boostrapped with [`create-nuxt-app`](https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app)

The Website can be found under: https://www.akalientess.com/

## Getting Started

First, run the command for install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You will find all pages under `pages` folder, so you can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.vue`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. Also, u will find all Components under `components` folder.

Styles are under `src/styles` folder. Styles are written in Dart Sass and every folder represents module which is styled.
If you want to change styles you need to run Sass watcher:

```bash
npm run watch
```
For Production, you need to run the build script for styles:
```bash
npm run style:build
```
